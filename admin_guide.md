# Getting Started

At SmartPass, we focused on making the onboarding process as simple as possible for schools. Below you will find an
instructional guide we made especially for our school administrators. It will help you delegate tasks and get the system
up and running in a matter of days.

To keep things simple, we've marked all tasks that you need to delegate in a TODO block. For example:

> #### SPTodo:: Example todo
> This is an example todo

## Required Tasks

To setup SmartPass, you need to accomplish the following two tasks:
1. [Create or sync SmartPass accounts](accounts.md)
2. [Add your rooms to SmartPass](rooms.md)
