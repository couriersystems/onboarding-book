<p>SmartPass uses the Global Grid for Learning to sync accounts from a Student Information System (SIS) such as
PowerSchool, Skyward, Aeris, GradeLink, and more. You can find the full list of supported SISs on <a href="https://gg4l.com/?s=&amp;post_type=product" target="_blank">GG4L&apos;s
website</a>.</p>
<div class="panel panel-info"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title" id="-why-integrate-with-gg4l"><i class="fa fa-info"></i>  Why integrate with GG4L?</h3></div><div class="panel-body"><p>If you don&apos;t integrate with GG4L already, here is a rundown of why we use them:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong>Secure SIS Data Roster Exchange</strong> </p>
<p>GG4L Connect is consent-based requiring the school Data Administrator to be 100% in control of inviting or<br>approving a Vendor to access a subset or all of the school&#x2019;s stored SIS data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy and Security</strong> </p>
<p>Privacy and Security for staff, students and guardians (and protecting the guardian-student relationship) are
rooted in strong proof-of-identity, identity management, and user accountability technology practices.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Governance</strong> </p>
<p>Provide oversight, accountability and regulatory compliance for digital learning applications and data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>IT Automation</strong> </p>
<p>Automated configuration, deployment and lifecycle management of cloud applications increases security, puts
applications to work faster and reduces costs. Deploy in minutes instead of days or weeks.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Application Usage Reporting</strong> </p>
<p>Gain visibility into how, when and from where students and staff are using applications and content. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Easy User Access</strong> </p>
<p>A personalized School Passport gives staff, students and guardians quick and easy access to digital resources in one place with a single login.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No Cost Membership</strong> </p>
<p>Schools and districts, anywhere in the world, are invited to join GG4L for free for life. GG4L does not charge 
schools and districts for core platform services.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>GG4L is a Public Benefit Corporation</strong> </p>
<p>GG4L is committed to doing good for the education community by providing safe, secure and cost-effective access to 
digital learning.</p>
</li>
</ul></div></div>
