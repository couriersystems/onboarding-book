            <h2 id="creating-smartpass-accounts">Creating SmartPass accounts</h2>
<p>There are a couple of options to create SmartPass accounts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload a spreadsheet with account information</li>
<li>Sync from a student information system (SIS) such as PowerSchool, Skyward, Aeris, Sapphire, and more</li>
<li>Sync from Google Suite for Education</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uploading-a-spreadsheet---quick--easy">Uploading a spreadsheet - Quick &amp; Easy</h3>
<p>The simplest and sometimes fastest method to add accounts into SmartPass is to upload a spreadsheet of emails and
names. If you don&apos;t need automatic syncing or just want to get the system up and running, this is the simplest option.</p>
<div class="panel panel-sp-todo"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title" id="-upload-account-spreadsheet"><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>  Upload account spreadsheet</h3></div><div class="panel-body"><p>Have any team member upload your accounts to SmartPass with an Excel spreadsheet.</p><p><a href="instructions/account_spreadsheet.html">Instructions</a></p><p><strong>Overview</strong>:</p><ol>
<li>Follow the instructions to create an appropriate spreadsheet</li>
<li>Email the spreadsheet to your SmartPass tech contact</li>
</ol></div></div>
<h3 id="sync-from-your-sis---robust">Sync from your SIS - Robust</h3>
<p>If your SIS is on the supported list, you can automatically sync your students from your SIS. An automatic sync gives
you better control over your accounts. SmartPass uses the Global Grid for Learning (GG4L) to sync with your SIS, so most
of the setup will be through their Edutone system. </p>

<li>If you don&apos;t already use GG4L, contact them to get setup and access their <em>free</em> benefits for schools.</li>
<li>Add SmartPass as a vendor in GG4L</li>
</ol></div></div>
<h3 id="google-suite-for-education-sync---sso">Google Suite for Education sync - SSO</h3>
<p>If your students already use Google apps such as Google Classroom, Drive, etc, syncing through G Suite for Education is
also a good option. This way, students can sign into SmartPass with their existing Google emails and passwords. </p>

<li>Authorize SmartPass to access your Google Suite for Education</li>

</ol></div></div>
<!-- **Steps:**
1. First, have your technical team send us an email with the subject ```Requesting Onboarding Link``` to
   support@smartpass.app. We will send them some technical information on how to authorize SmartPass and connect us to
   your Google Suite for Education.

2. In cooperation with your tech team, we will use the appropriate organizational units in Google Suite to sync your
   accounts automatically.
