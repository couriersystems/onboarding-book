## Creating SmartPass accounts
There are a couple of options to create SmartPass accounts.
- Upload a spreadsheet with account information
- Sync from a student information system (SIS) such as PowerSchool, Skyward, Aeris, Sapphire, and more
- Sync from Google Suite for Education

### Uploading a spreadsheet - Quick & Easy
The simplest and sometimes fastest method to add accounts into SmartPass is to upload a spreadsheet of emails and
names. If you don't need automatic syncing or just want to get the system up and running, this is the simplest option.

### Sync from your SIS - Robust
If your SIS is on the supported list, you can automatically sync your students from your SIS. An automatic sync gives
you better control over your accounts. SmartPass uses the Global Grid for Learning (GG4L) to sync with your SIS, so most
of the setup will be through their Edutone system.

>   1. If you don't already use GG4L, contact them to get setup and access their *free* benefits for schools.
>   2. Add SmartPass as a vendor in GG4L

### Google Suite for Education sync - SSO
If your students already use Google apps such as Google Classroom, Drive, etc, syncing through G Suite for Education is
also a good option. This way, students can sign into SmartPass with their existing Google emails and passwords.

<!-- **Steps:**
1. First, have your technical team send us an email with the subject ```Requesting Onboarding Link``` to
   support@smartpass.app. We will send them some technical information on how to authorize SmartPass and connect us to
   your Google Suite for Education.

2. In cooperation with your tech team, we will use the appropriate organizational units in Google Suite to sync your
   accounts automatically.
