# Add accounts with a spreadsheet

This is the simplest way to add accounts into SmartPass. We recommend using this method if you want to try the system
out with a handful of teachers and students, but this isn't a long term solution. Syncing through GG4L or G Suite is a
much more robust method to add accounts to SmartPass.

> #### SPTodo:: Creating an account spreadsheet
> SmartPass has 4 account types: students, teachers, admins, and assistants. For each account type that you want to add
> users into, create a separate spreadsheet. You can always add individual users at any time, so only make spreadsheets
> when you want to bulk add users.
> 
> 1. Create a spreadsheet with the following columns:
>   - First name
>   - Last name
>   - Email
>   - Password (If omitted, we will generate a password for you. Users can change their password at any time.)
> 2. Name the spreadsheet with the appropriate account type and send them all to your tech rep.
> 3. Your tech rep will confirm that the accounts have been added.
