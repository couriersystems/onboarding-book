# Add and configure rooms

Use this instructional guide to add and configure rooms in SmartPass. It will serve as a starting point for your room
setup. Later on, you can customize it to your needs. In this guide we will:
- Upload all classrooms into a folder using a spreadsheet
- Add individual rooms as it's own tile
- Customize advanced settings

If you need help at any step email your tech representative, or checkout our [documentation on rooms](https://www.smartpass.app/support).

### Ensure all of your teacher accounts have been added
One of the important steps in room setup is assigning teachers to their respective rooms. Teacher accounts need to be
imported before this can be done. Ensure that you have already added all your teachers to SmartPass.

### Use folders to bulk add your classrooms
Folders are a great way to organize rooms and make it easy for students to find the rooms they need. We will first
upload all of your classrooms (rooms where teachers teach) into SmartPass.
