# Sync accounts from G Suite

Use this instructional guide to setup G Suite Syncing for your SmartPass accounts.

####1. Authorize SmartPass to access your G Suite

First, send an email to support@smartpass.app with the subject `Requesting Onboarding Link` and include the name of your
school. Our tech team will send you a special link that will allow you to give SmartPass access to your G Suite.

Once you receive the link, login with your G Suite admin account and follow the prompts.
