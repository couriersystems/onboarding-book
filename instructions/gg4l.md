# Getting started with GG4L

SmartPass uses the Global Grid for Learning to sync accounts from a Student Information System (SIS) such as
PowerSchool, Skyward, Aeris, GradeLink, and more. You can find the full list of supported SISs on [GG4L's
website](https://gg4l.com/?s=&post_type=product).

> #### info:: Why integrate with GG4L?
> If you don't integrate with GG4L already, here is a rundown of why we use them:
> - **Secure SIS Data Roster Exchange**

>   GG4L Connect is consent-based requiring the school Data Administrator to be 100% in control of inviting or   
>   approving a Vendor to access a subset or all of the schoolâ€™s stored SIS data.
> 
> - **Privacy and Security** 
> 
>   Privacy and Security for staff, students and guardians (and protecting the guardian-student relationship) are
>   rooted in strong proof-of-identity, identity management, and user accountability technology practices.

> 
>   Provide oversight, accountability and regulatory compliance for digital learning applications and data.
