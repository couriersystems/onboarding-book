# What is SmartPass?

SmartPass is a digital hall pass system that replaces traditional sign-out books, paper passes, and wooden blocks. It 
allows you to have complete oversight on how your students travel through your hallways during class time.

### How it works
Instead of signing out on a sign-out sheet, or carrying a wooden block, students use SmartPass to
create a hall pass for themselves. Imagine the typical scenario of a student need to use the restroom. The student
raises their hand, asks for verbal permission to use the bathroom, and now they use either a school issued or personal
device to make a digital pass. 

With a digital pass, school administrators have a rock-solid record of where students currently are in the building and
where they have been. There's no mess of emailing teachers, or trying to decipher vague sign out times and messy
handwriting. With a digital system, you can do so much more! 

### What can SmartPass do?
Here are some administrator objectives that SmartPass can help you accomplish:
- **Increase time spent in class**
  
    Loitering in the hallways is much more difficult with SmartPass. Combined with appropriate school rules, SmartPass
    is an effective tool to encourage students to stay in the classroom.

- **Increase student safety during emergencies**
  
    Quickly understand which students are in your hallways during a fire or building intruder. Print out a hallway
    report and ensure that all of your students are with a teacher.

- **Detect and discourage disruptive behavior**
  
    Easily detect, prevent, and remediate bad behavior outside of the classroom. SmartPass's accurate digital record and
    reporting system makes it easy for admins to ensure their school runs smoothly.

- **Quickly find answers with our comprehensive search**
  
    Find vandalism in a bathroom? Easily find out who was in a room around a certain time. 

- **Schedule passes for students easily**
  
    Send students passes ahead of time to save paper and frustration. Schedule counselor appointments, college visits,
    group activities, and more.

- **Powerful room and hallway control**
  
    Customize your room setup and permissions for your school. SmartPass gives you full control on where a student can
    go with and without prior digital permission.
