##### Ex 1. All restricted rooms
Set all rooms to restricted if you want every pass a student makes to be approved by a teacher or admin. Once a student
requests to go to a room, a teacher can approve that request through smartpass. The student then automatically gets a
pass to that room. 

##### Ex 2. Combination of unrestricted and restricted
Set certain rooms to restricted to control access to certain rooms or events. For example, restrict special rooms such
as a printer room, or supply room, to ensure students always have digital permission before going to that room.

##### Ex 3. Make all rooms restricted
Have teachers approve all passes that students make. This ensures that teachers always have full control over what
passes students make. 

Next, actually add your rooms to SmartPass using a SmartPass admin account.
