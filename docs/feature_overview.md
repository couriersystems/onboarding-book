# What can SmartPass do?

With an accurate digital record of your students' activity outside the classroom, SmartPass gives you powerful
administration tools.

## A comprehensive search tool
Find an act of vandalism in one of your bathrooms? Need to know who was in the hallway during a bullying situation? Use
the search tab to quickly and easily find the involved students.

## Increase the time-spent in class
Loitering in the hallways is much more difficult with SmartPass. Combined with appropriate school rules, SmartPass is an
effective tool to encourage students to stay in the classroom.

## Schedule passes for students easily
Schedule passes in advance to send one or more students to a college visit room, a counseling session, nurse check ups
and more. Avoid the hassle of printing and distributing paper passes.

## Powerful room and hallway control
Need an easy way to manage the number of students in a library or recreation room? Use SmartPass to automatically limit
the number of people in any room. Additionally, you can use building wide pass limits to ensure that hallways always
have a manageable amount of students in them.
