# Setting up rooms

This page explains how you can create SmartPass rooms and how you can customize your setup to get the most out of the
system for your school.

### What is a SmartPass room?

A SmartPass room is the digital representation of your school's rooms. Typical rooms that schools add to SmartPass
include Bathrooms, Classrooms, Library, Nurse's Office, Locker, and more. If you want to monitor student activity to a
location, you should have a SmartPass room setup for it.

In addition to monitoring activity in a physical room, you can also use SmartPass rooms to monitor and control
activities or events. For example, a common activity is an early dismissal and some common events include a college
visit, counselor meetings, and more.

### Restricted Rooms
Rooms in SmartPass have a restricted setting. When a room is restricted, students will need prior digital approval
before they are given a pass for that room. Your school can use a combination of restricted and unrestricted rooms to
control how your students can make passes. For example, ```Put awesome example here```!!

### Setup
Get the most out of the system by discussing how you will configure your SmartPass rooms. Reference the following
three most common setups to determine what will work best for your school.

> #### SPTODO:: Discuss and determine how you will use SmartPass rooms
> 1. Discuss with your team which physical locations should have SmartPass rooms, if not all, and how you will use restricted rooms.
> 2. Brainstorm different activities or events that can be monitored and controlled with SmartPass.
> 3. Discuss any additional needs or issues with your support representative. They are SmartPass gurus!

##### Ex 1. All restricted rooms
Set all rooms to restricted if you want every pass a student makes to be approved by a teacher or admin. Once a student
requests to go to a room, a teacher can approve that request through smartpass. The student then automatically gets a
pass to that room. 

##### Ex 2. Combination of unrestricted and restricted
Set certain rooms to restricted to control access to certain rooms or events. For example, **<-- finish this** 



Next, actually add your rooms to SmartPass using a SmartPass admin account.
