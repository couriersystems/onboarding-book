<p>SmartPass is a digital hall pass system that replaces traditional sign-out books, paper passes, and wooden blocks. It 
allows you to have complete oversight on how your students travel through your hallways during class time.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>
<p>Imagine the typical scenario of a student needing to use the restroom. Ben is the student of Mr. Roger and they are
 currently in room A101. After raising his hand and getting verbal permission from Mr. Roger, Ben uses his personal or school issued device to make a pass to the restroom.</p>
<p>Immediately after creating the pass, two things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mr. Roger gets an alert on his laptop or mobile device which says that Ben made a pass to the restroom.</li>
<li>Any teacher or administrator viewing the Hall Monitor page immediately sees Ben&#x2019;s pass to the restroom pop up on
their screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the pass made, Ben can now travel to the restroom. As he travels, the time remaining on the pass ticks down which
encourages his timely return to the classroom. If Ben were to keep his pass active past the allowed time, it would start
counting up again. This ensures that Ben&#x2019;s entire time outside of the classroom is accounted for. At a later time,
perhaps at the end of the week, a SmartPass administrator can view these expired passes. </p>
<p>After Ben ends his pass, Mr. Roger receives another alert that Ben ended his pass. If Ben were to end his pass before he came back, Mr. Roger would know. This system of alerts keeps your students accountable.</p>
